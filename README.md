# Graph Data Structure Problems

This repository contains various graph-related problems and their solutions in Java.

Graphs are a fundamental part of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and are widely used to model real-world problems like maps, networks, and social connections. Understanding graph algorithms is essential for technical interviews and competitive programming.

Topics include BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms, minimum spanning trees, cycle detection, strongly connected components, and more.
